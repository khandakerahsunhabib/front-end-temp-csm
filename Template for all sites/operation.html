                <p>Routine grill maintenance is crucial for several reasons:</p>
                <ul class="check-square">
                    <li><strong>Safety:</strong> A clean grill prevents flare-ups caused by grease buildup. It reduces
                        the risk of
                        fires.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Clean grills heat more evenly and ensure your food is perfectly
                        cooked.</li>
                    <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> Proper maintenance protects your investment by extending your
                        grill's life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hygiene:</strong> Regular cleaning removes harmful bacteria and residue. It ensures safe
                        food
                        preparation.</li>
