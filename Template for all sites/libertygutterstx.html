    <ul class="check-square">
    <li><strong>Mold:</strong> Any sign of mold suggests that your current gutter system is not moving away from your property in the manner that it should. It is time for a replacement.</li>
    <li><strong>Repeated Clogging:</strong> All gutters can get clogged on occasion. When the issue resurfaces regularly, you need to get an upgraded gutter system before your current one start to sag, causes leaks, and triggers water damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaky Gutters:</strong> Many gutter leaks can be repaired. Some, however, are beyond repair because of rust, peeling paint, and improper maintenance. In these cases, a fresh gutter system upgrade is in order.</li>
    <li><strong>Moisture in the Attic:</strong> Dampness in your attic suggests that your gutter system is not redirecting as much water from your roof as it should. A fresh solution is in order.</li>
